## Before You Begin

The "Watson Data Platform" lab is done using the IBM cloud. It uses a set of fully managed cloud services; Cloudant and dashDB for Analytics to persist data and Data Connect to ingest data. These services are available in Bluemix, IBM’s cloud platform as a service (PaaS). It also uses Watson Analytics, IBM’s smart data discovery service on the cloud and the IBM Data Science Experience, an interactive, collaborative, cloud-based environment where data scientists can use multiple tools to activate their insights. Lastly, you will be required to download a few files that are supplied that you will use as source datasets.

## Workflow

On the following pages are a series of steps you will perform before you do any of the labs. Each step outlines an easy to follow set of instructions that will prepare your cloud environment so you can do any of the labs you choose. It has been designed as a serial process so it’s important that you follow each step in sequence and do not deviate from the workflow or skip any steps in the process.
