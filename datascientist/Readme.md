### Get Started with IBM Data Science Experience

Welcome to the IBM Data Science Experience (DSX). Here you can explore, analyze, visualize, and share your data. Before you start, you’ll need a Bluemix account.

If you don’t have a Bluemix account, follow the steps to create one [here]( https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/).

Once you fill out the form to sign up, check your email for an activation code. Once you have the activation code, you can complete the Bluemix sign up process. Now that you have a Bluemix account, you can login from the [DSX landing page]( http://datascience.ibm.com/).

If you have a Bluemix account, click the Log In button on the DSX landing page to sign in with your Bluemix credentials. Type in your Bluemix email address and password, then click Sign In.

You are now in the Data Science Experience. Depending on the plan you chose, your environment is automatically set up with at least one Apache Spark instance and at least 5 GB of object storage.
From here you can create a new project, notebook, or connection. You can also explore any of the tutorials, videos, sample notebooks or articles in the community.
