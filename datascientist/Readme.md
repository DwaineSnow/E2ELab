As a Data Scientist, you have to turn raw data into meaning using state-of-the-art techniques leveraging open source and enterprise applications. Perform hands-on exercises leveraging Apache Spark, Jupyter, Python, and R to derive sales performance for a specific product line, then build an advanced Machine Learning model in R.

You are now in the Data Science Experience. Depending on the plan you chose, your environment is automatically set up with at least one Apache Spark instance and at least 5 GB of object storage.
From here you can create a new project, notebook, or connection. You can also explore any of the tutorials, videos, sample notebooks or articles in the community.
