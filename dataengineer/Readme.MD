#Hands on Lab - Data Engineer
[<img src="https://github.com/ibmdataworks/datafirst/raw/master/datascientist/media/DEE2E.png">](https://github.com/ibmdataworks/datafirst/tree/master/dataengineer)

As a Data Engineer, you are constantly challenged with the expediated task of delivering quality, trusted data to business users, data scientists and application developers. Time is always of the essence, so you need the ablity to quickly and easily find, access, combine, cleanse, standardize and prepare the data and then deliver it to those who need it when they need it to support analytical and application use cases. 

The IBM Bluemix Data Connect service, an intergral part of the Watson Data Platform, help solves these challenges.

Bluemix Data Connect is a fully managed, self-service, data preparation and integration service which enables you to easily put data to work. It provides instant access to your data wherever it resides, on the cloud or on-premises. You can blend data together from multiple relevant data sources to create powerful insights and then transform the data by refining and cleansing it, using a robust catalog of transformation operations and then deliver it with confidence to one of many supported cloud or on-premises targets.

Data Connect is fully managed by IBM in the cloud, so you can sleep better at night, with Pay-as-you-go and subscription pricing options to get started quickly. It’s powered by Spark for a speedy and responsive experience and can easily integrate data across different platforms and is seamlessly integrated with Watson Analytics. Bluemix Data Connect empowers non-technical and technical users to simply put data to work.

With Data Connect, Data Engineers can enable self-service data access to end users using elastic deployment through the cloud and delver the data faster while maintaining important controls such as data governance and security. This allows them to break free from routine data requests and focus on additional value for an organization such as implementing and enforcing corporate standards, security, data governance and complex requirements. Data Connect saves time and resources by reducing the effort to provision trusted data and make it fit for use.

This lab will demonstrate how a data engineer can utilize the following capabilities of the Data Connect service: 

* Creating and Working with the Bluemix Data Connect service
*	Creating and Working with Bluemix Data Connect Connections
*	Visualizing and Understanding Data Quality and Content
*	Transforming and Standardizing Data
*	Executing and Monitoring Data Activities
* Persiting data into the Watson Analytics repository

DataWorks Forge Service Introduction
------------------------------------

 > <img src="./media/DE Image9.png"/>
 >
 > NOTE: The Bluemix Secure gateway can be used to retrieve data hosted in a secure enterprise environment through a secure network tunnel. Configuring a Secure Gateway service and connecting using a secure tunnel is a simple and intuitive process (the dashboard walks you through the steps). As it was indicated earlier, getting access to a data hosted in an enterprise infrastructure can be a compliance and privacy issue for this lab, we will be using a sample datasets hosted in the IBM Object Storage that would be used as a source data set. This doesn’t need the use of a secure gateway.

Create Data Flow (Activity)
---------------------------

1.  From the DataWorks Forge dashboard click on “Tasks”-&gt;“Refine and Copy”

2.  Click and select the source database: SourceDB

3.  Click and select the Container: datafirst

4.  Click and select the files (checkbox) from the container: GOProductDim, GOSalesFact

 > At this point you have the options of either **copying/migrating the selected data files as-is** to the target OR **refine the data** from the selected files and then copy/migrate it.

### Copy data as-is

5.  Edit the activity name by clicking the pencil icon (<img src="./media/image15.png" width="33" height="36" />) on top of the dashboard. Name the activity “LoadDataAsIs”. Click <img src="./media/image16.png" width="34" height="34" /> when done with editing.

6.  Click on “COPY TO TARGET”

7.  Click and select the target database: TargetDB

8.  Select the database schema to which the data needs to be copied to.

 > NOTE: Since we are using an entry plan dashDB for this lab exercise the schema name would look similar to the dashDB userid (e.g., DASH99999)

9.  In the “Table Action” column you are prompted with 4 options “Append to the table”, “Recreate the table”, “Replace the table contents” and “Merge with the table”. Since this is the first time we are copying data, select “Recreate the table”

 > NOTE: If the table does not exist, it will be created and data will be appended.

10.  Now you can either “SCHEDULE” this activity for a later run or “RUN” this activity immediately. Click on “RUN” to execute it immediately

11.  The activity is executed immediately. An icon is added to the activity list dashboard. We will revisit this icon in the later section.

> <img src="./media/image17.png" width="193" height="71" />
>
> **IMPORTANT**: You would have noticed that while creating the target database we never ported the schema. This is because, if the schema doesn’t exist in the target database, it is created automatically from the source data type. This feature enhances and expedites the overall project productivity.

### Refine data (OPTIONAL)

> NOTE: Skip to next section titled “**Validate Data Flow Run Activity** “ if you don’t want to refine the data before copying else continue.

1.  Repeat steps 1 to 4. **Come back to this step once complete**.

2.  Edit the activity name by clicking the pencil icon (<img src="./media/image15.png" width="33" height="36" />) on top of the dashboard. Name the activity “RefineAndLoadData”. Click <img src="./media/image16.png" width="34" height="34" /> when done with editing.

3.  Click on “REFINE DATA”

4.  This brings you to the refine dashboard where you can do various operations on the selected table.

 > For the tables, it provides you a histogram and statistics of the data quality for each of the table columns. You can cleanse the data (standardize values, remove rows/columns, change value, filter and sort rows etc.)
 >
 > You are at liberty to explore and act on these options. Once complete click on “NEXT”

5.  Continue steps 7 to 10. **Come back to this step once complete**.

6.  The activity is executed immediately and an icon is added to the activity list dashboard.

 > <img src="./media/image18.png" width="235" height="87" />

Validate Data Flow Run Activity
-------------------------------

1.  From the DataWorks Forge dashboard click on “Browse”-&gt;“Activities”

2.  Click on the three dots (<img src="./media/image19.png" width="17" height="37" />) on the right-top corner for the activity titled “LoadDataAsIs”. This will pop up additional sub-activity icons

 > <img src="./media/image20.png" width="267" height="157" />
 > 
 > You can Run (<img src="./media/image21.png" width="43" height="42" />), Schedule (<img src="./media/image22.png" width="45" height="45" />), delete (<img src="./media/image23.png" width="42" height="42" />) the activity OR find more details (<img src="./media/image24.png" width="41" height="42" />) about the run.

3.  Let find out about the detailed status of the run. Either click on the activity name icon “LoadDataAsIs“ or click on the expanded details (<img src="./media/image24.png" width="41" height="42" />) icon.

 > <img src="./media/image25.png" width="559" height="349" /><img src="./media/image26.png" width="559" height="379" />
 >
 > It will show you an information screen (similar to the figure above). Here, check if the activity details match with the information it was created with and whether the activity was run successfully. You can also rerun or schedule a run of the activity without having to recreate it again. You can see the detailed **runlog** of the activity by clicking on the named “Activity Runs” (circled in the earlier figure).

Validate Migrated Data
----------------------

1.  Go to the main Bluemix portal and click on DASHBOARD (Top of the browser)

 > NOTE: You may already have a browser tab open from where you invoked the DataWorks Forge service (<img src="./media/image27.png" width="278" height="42" />). Go to that tab and click on <img src="./media/image28.png" width="121" height="28" />. This will take you back to the provisioned services dashboard.

2.  Under the Services section on this browser page click on the dashDB service that was created in section titled “Initialize Target Data Repository: dashDB Service “.

3.  This will open up the dashDB launch board. Click on the “OPEN” button. This will launch the dashDB dashboard.

4.  To verify the data you have 2 Options

> **Option 1**

1.  Click on “Run SQL” and execute the “SELECT COUNT(\*) FROM *&lt;SchemaName.TableName&gt;”* SQL commands against the GOProductDim and GOSalesFact table name. The resultant row counts should be 274 and 10000 rows respectively.

2.  You can also run other SELECT commands to check if the resultant data is valid especially if you have refined the incoming data.

> NOTE: For this lab the *SchemaName would be the* username as indicated in section titled Initialize Target Data Repository: dashDB Service step 4.
>
> **Option 2**

1.  Click on “Tables”

2.  Select the Schema

3.  For each table GOProductDim and GOSalesFact verify the schema and also browse the data.
